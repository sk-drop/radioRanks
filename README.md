# How do german radio stations differ?
## (a study to rank german radio stations based on sentiments, themes and variety)

### Disclaimer: I came up with this study purely for learning purposes and got no bad intentions against certain radiostations

In this experiment I will scrape the playlists of the top 10 radio stations in germany.  
They won't give them to me, so I'll have take 'em on my own. (**data collection,webscraping**)  
Because the currently played songs aren't collectively displayed, I'll have to automate the scraping scripts. (**automation**)  
Then I'll feed the songs into the Musixmatch API and hopefully receive the lyrics of each song. (**api handling**)
Last but not least, I'll descriptively analyse the song data using sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, etc..,  
enabling me to rank and differentiate the radiostations based on their songs. (**descriptive/sentiment analysis, modelling**)

My goal is essentially to practice:  
- webscraping and caching  
- automation
- api handling  
- descriptive analysis
- sentiment analysis 
- modelling
